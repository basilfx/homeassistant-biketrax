  already have one, then merge its contents.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=biketrax)

## Known issues
When read-only mode is enabled, the switches do not reflect this mode properly.
If you try to toggle a switch, it will eventually restore to its actual state.

I do not really know how to handle this properly, without changing the entity
type.

## References
This custom component builds on top of
[aiobiketrax](https://github.com/basilfx/aiobiketrax).

### Debug logging
Additional debug logging can be enabled via the [Logger](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logger/)
component. See the configuration below to enable debug logging for this integration.

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    aiobiketrax: debug
    custom_components.biketrax: debug
```

See the [README.md](https://github.com/basilfx/aiobiketrax/blob/master/README.md)
of `aiobiketrax` for more information.

### Development version
If you ever need to use a newer version of `aiobiketrax` with this integration,
you can edit `custom_components/biketrax/manifest.json` and adapt the
requirements section to point to a newer version:

```json
"requirements": [
  "aiobiketrax @ git+https://github.com/basilfx/aiobiketrax.git@master"
]
```

Shut-down Home Assistant, remove the old dependency and then restart
Home Assistant. The latest version will be fetched from GitHub directly.

Removing a dependency depends on your installation. In a supervised
installation, you can try the following:

```bash
docker exec -it homeassistant bash
pip uninstall aiobiketrax
```
